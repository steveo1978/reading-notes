+ **JavaScript is written in plain text just like html and css so you do not need any new tools to write script.**

+ **You use the html of <'script'> when you want to use JavaScript on a web page.** 

+ **It is better to put scripts in their own files but you can still place the html in between two opening and closing script tags.**

+ **When the browser comes across a <'script'> element, it stops to load the script and then checks to see if it needs to do anything further.**
