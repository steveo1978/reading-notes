# Read 06 B Computer Architecture and Logic

## 1. **Computers** - 
A. *Take in input* 

B. *Keep the input ('storage').*

C. *Be able to process the imput.*

D. *Then have the ability to output or sent the info back out.*

## 2. Computers started out as basic calculators. 
## 3. A bit is the smallest piece of info a computer can store.
## 4. When you add more wires to a computer you get more bits, therefore you get a more powerfull    computer.
## 5. Computers use the Binary number system.
## 6. An adder circut takes in 2 bits and adds them together to make the same sum.
## 7. A computer will input information by converting info into binary info
## 8. Memory then stores the information that it recieves.
## 9. The CPU or Central Processing Unit will then caculate the information.
## 10. Then finally, the information will then get outputted which is converting the information to a physical output.
## 11. The CPU is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer.
## 12. The CPU uses simple commands the tell it which circut to use.
## 13. The software on a CPU tells it what to do.
