# Read 06 B Computer Architecture and Logic

   ## 1. Computers - 
            1. Take in input  
            1. Keep the input ('storage').
            1. Be able to process the imput.
            1. Then have the ability to output or sent the info back out.

## 1. Computers started out as basic calculators. 
## 1. A bit is the smallest piece of info a computer can store.
## 1. When you add more wires to a computer you get more bits, therefore you get a more powerfull    computer.
## 1. Computers use the Binary number system.
## 1. An adder circut takes in 2 bits and adds them together to make the same sum.
## 1. A computer will input information by converting info into binary info
## 1. Memory then stores the information that it recieves.
## 1. The CPU or Central Processing Unit will then caculate the information.
## 1. Then finally, the information will then get outputted which is converting the information to a physical output.
## 1. The CPU is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer.
## 1. The CPU uses simple commands the tell it which circut to use.
## 1. The software on a CPU tells it what to do.
