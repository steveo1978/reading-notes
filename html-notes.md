# **These are my notes for HTML** 


 - ## HTML-**hyper text markup language**

  - ### *HTML pages are text documents*

  - *html uses tags*

  - *Tags are often referred to as elements*

  - *Tags come in pairs. Opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.*

  - *Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of the element.*

  - *The new html5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe it's signature.*

  - *The new elements provide clearer code '(compared with using multiple <div> elements)'.*

  - *An unordered list element is ul in html*

  - *To make html5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 '(and older versions of Ie)', extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from google.*
